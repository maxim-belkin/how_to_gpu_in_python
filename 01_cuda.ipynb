    "First, let's address the most important question -- what is CUDA? Is it a programming language? A driver? A hardware architecture? CUDA stands for **Compute Unified Device Architecture**. In its first [Programming Guide][cuda-1.0], NVIDIA described it as a new type of hardware and software architecture for performing general-purpose computations on NVIDIA GPUs without having to use a graphics API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, CUDA ecosystem encompases programming, execution, and memory models, a rich collection of GPU-accelerated libraries, a debugger, a profiler, a compiler, a driver, a toolkit, an integrated development environment, extensions to programming languages such as C and Fortran (called CUDA C and CUDA Fortran), and other tools and know-hows. It is not uncommon to hear people say \"CUDA Programming\" when they refer to programming in CUDA C or CUDA Fortran, GPGPU programming on NVIDIA GPUs, and even GPGPU programming in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the original question, we can say that CUDA is an all-encompassing solution that enables us to program NVIDIA graphics cards the same way we program CPUs.\n",
    "In this guide, we will review the programming concepts and hardware details which are essential to CUDA Programming. This information will help you better understand CUDA-oriented Python packages.\n",

Understandably, one may want to use GPUs for something more useful, for example, to process or analyze data. Here we have to step back and remind ourselves that CPU-GPU systems are heterogeneous and both CPU and GPU can access their own memory only. This means that in order to process data on the GPU, we have to  transfer it there. Of course, to view or save the results we have to transfer them back to the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA provides two sister functions for transferring data between the host and device: `cudaMemcpy` and `cudaMemcpyAsync`. They work exactly the same way but the latter one is asynchronous and is used in advanced applications when data throughput is of critical importance.\n",

    "- `nbytes`: transferred data size in bytes,\n",

    "As you can see, NVIDIA GPU architecture is built around Streaming Multiprocessors that house all the computing resources: CUDA cores, Load/Store units, Special Function Units, Register file, Shared memory, warps, and etc. Parallelism is achieved by replicating Streaming Multipricessors, so a more powerful GPU can be constructed by increasing the number of these SMs.\n",

    "### SMs, kernels, and grids\n",
    "\n",
    "When a kernel grid is launched, the thread blocks of that kernel grid are distributed among available SMs for execution. Once _scheduled_ on an SM, threads of a thread block _execute_ concurrently only on that assigned SM. Multiple thread blocks may be assigned to the same SM at once and are scheduled based on the availability of SM resources (there is a limit on the number of threads an SM can run concurrently).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warps and SIMT\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA employes a Signle Instruction Multiple Thread (SIMT) architecture to manage and execute threads in groups of 32 called warps. All threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time. Each SM partitions the thread blocks assigned to it into 32-thread warps that it then schedules for execution on available hardware resources. The SIMT architecture is similar to SIMD except that SIMT allows multiple threads in the same warp to execute independently, whereas SIMD requires synchronous execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic number: 32\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned above, warps are groups of 32 threads. 32 is a magic number in CUDA programming. Optimiting your workloads to fit within the boundaries of a warp will generally lead to better utilization of GPU resources and, therefore, better performance of your application. That's why programmers often use blocks of 32, 64, 128, and 1024 threads. Note that there is a limit on the number of threads per block -- 1024, which corresponds to 32 warps."
